            <h1 class="text-left">What's BMI?</h1>
            <p style="text-align: justify ;">BMI is a measurement of a person's leanness or corpulence based on their height and weight, and is intended to quantify tissue mass. It is widely used as a general indicator of whether a person has a healthy body weight for their height. Specifically, the value obtained from the calculation of BMI is used to categorize whether a person is underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese depending on what range the value falls between. These ranges of BMI vary based on factors such as region and age, and are sometimes further divided into subcategories such as severely underweight or very severely obese. Being overweight or underweight can have significant health effects, so while BMI is an imperfect measure of healthy body weight, it is a useful indicator of whether any additional testing or action is required. Refer to the table below to see the different categories based on BMI that are used by the calculator.</p>

            <h1 class="text-left"> BMI Formula</h1>
            <p>BMI, or Body Mass Index, is a numerical value used to assess a person's weight in relation to their height. It is calculated using the following formula:</p>
            <p class="formula text-center fs-2 danger text-light">BMI = <span id="mass">Mass (kg)</span> / <span id="height">Height (m)<sup>2</sup></span></p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
                <li><span id="mass">Mass in kg</span>: The person's weight in kilograms (kg).</li>
                <li><span id="height">Height in meters</span>: The person's height in meters (m).</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Interpreting BMI:</h2>
            <p>Here's a general guideline for interpreting BMI values:</p>
            <ul style="margin-left: 50px;">
                <li>Underweight: BMI less than 18.5</li>
                <li>Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9</li>
                <li>Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9</li>
                <li>Obese: BMI between 30 and 34.9</li>
                <li>Extremely obese: BMI greater than 35</li>
            </ul>
